Fonts
For a truly Old Norse feel, consider using fonts that mimic runic scripts or ancient Viking lettering. Here are a few font suggestions:

Elder Futhark: A font that mimics the ancient runic script used by early Germanic tribes. Perfect for headings and titles.

Drakkar: Inspired by the bold, angular shapes of Viking runes, this font is great for a strong, dramatic impact.

Norse: A more modern take on runic scripts, it's readable while still evoking the ancient Norse feel.

Jotun: A font that resembles the rugged and wild nature of the Viking Age. Ideal for headings and accent text.

Color Scheme
For the color palette, let's draw inspiration from the natural elements and artifacts of the Viking world. Here's a suggested color scheme:

Dark Iron (Primary Color): A deep, almost black gray, reminiscent of iron and steel used in Viking weaponry.

Hex: #1F1F1F

Runestone Gray (Secondary Color): A muted, stone-like gray, evoking the look of ancient runestones.

Hex: #5A5A5A

Shield Red (Accent Color): A bold, deep red, symbolizing the blood and valor of the Viking warriors.

Hex: #A52A2A

Sea Blue (Accent Color): A rich, dark blue, representing the Nordic seas that the Vikings sailed.

Hex: #0E4D64

Gold (Highlight Color): A muted, antique gold, evoking the treasures and artifacts of the Viking Age.

Hex: #C5A880

Parchment (Background Color): A light, parchment-like beige, providing a neutral backdrop for text and images.

Example Usage
Headings and Titles: Use Elder Futhark or Drakkar with Dark Iron or Shield Red.

Body Text: Use a more readable font like Norse or Jotun in Runestone Gray or Sea Blue.

Accents and Highlights: Incorporate Shield Red and Gold for buttons, icons, and important elements.

Background: Parchment can serve as the main background color, creating a warm, inviting look.

Implementation Tips
Consistency: Ensure consistent use of fonts and colors throughout the app to maintain a cohesive look.

Readability: While stylized fonts are great for headings, ensure body text remains readable for the best user experience.

Contrast: Use contrasting colors to make important elements stand out and guide the user's eye.
